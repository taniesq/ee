I met a traveller from an antique land
He said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert
Near them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies
Its frown, and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Yet they survive, stamped on these lifeless things, the hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed
And on the pedestal, these words appear My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings
Look on my Works ye Mighty and despair
Nothing beside remains
Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare, the lone and level sands stretch far awayI met a traveller from an antique land
He said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert
Near them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies
Its frown, and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Yet they survive, stamped on these lifeless things, the hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed
